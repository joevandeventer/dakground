# README.md

Nothing to see here! This is just a very basic Flask app that looks for images in the app's `images` directory, and returns one at random. I assume there are five million scripts out there that do this already. I just use it on my home network to serve background images from my Synology to my [Dakboard](https://dakboard.com/).
